Modern, half-finished, bytecode manipulation library... made by crackers and aimed at the JVM
Used to be private, now open-source.

# Todo
Still a bunch of stuff left, mainly:
- support for `invokedynamic`
- support for `lookupswitch` and `tableswitch`
- support for inner classes
- stackmap frame computations
- stack & local max computations
- better error handling

# Contributions
As said in the segment above there are a still plenty of issues with this which need to be adressed.
If you are willing to do so pull requests are always welcome.
